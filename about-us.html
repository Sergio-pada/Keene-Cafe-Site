			<p>The Keene Cafe was established and bridges from possible in the 1920's and converted into saboteurs, became
				Ethel's best a boarding house in the early
				customers.
				30's for miners working at the Tweedy Canyon limestone mine & kilns.
				In 1940 Ethel Stuck began operating the Keene Caf√© and returned it into a roadside cafe serving US route 466
				(spur of historic US route 66). As luck would have it, World War Il would work in her favor.
				Soldiers stationed in the Keene area, to guard railroad tunnels
				During this time the industrious
				Ethel Stuck pioneered the idea of displaying wildflowers as a marketing gimmick to draw more business. Soon she
				had 282 varieties of wildflowers and an impressive roadside display attracting scores of visitors.
				Many people credit Ethel for the subsequent wildflower show that sprang up throughout Kern
				County.
				Ethel continued to operate the Keene Cafe until 1954. Since that time US route 466 has become Hwy 58 but people
				like Pete Errecart, Ruby and Woody Woods, Ed and Ethel Melton, and Charlie Lund continued serving good home
				cooked meals to locals and hungry travelers alike, in an atmosphere of days gone by. It's a tradition started
				over 80 years ago that continues today.
				<br></br>Welcome to the Historic Keene
				Cafe.
